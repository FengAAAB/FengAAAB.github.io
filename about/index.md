Our aim is to answer a fundamental questions: **How could robots learn like us ?** We achieve this by developing new **robot learning models** using machine learning theories. 

Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires understanding of different fields. Ecept machine leanring, we also investigate on computational We conduct both fundamental and applied research in our [social robotics lab](hri.research.it.uu.se).
