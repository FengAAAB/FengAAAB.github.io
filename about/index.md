In our [Uppsala](http://uu.se/en/) social robotics lab, we aim to answer a fundamental question: **How could robots learn like humans ?** We achieve this by researching and developing new **robot learning models** using machine learning theories. The key of our research is to understand _what interactive elements make the learning process different_ and _how could we build efficient learning models for human robot interaction_. 
Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires knowledge of different fields. Except machine leanring algorithms, we also investigate on computational psychology models. We conduct both fundamental and applied research in our [social robotics lab](http://hri.research.it.uu.se/people.html).
