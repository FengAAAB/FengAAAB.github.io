Our aim is to answer a fundamental questions: **How could robots learn like us ?** We achieve this by developing new **robot learning models** using machine learning theories. The key of our research is to understand _what interactive elements make the learning process different_ and _how could we build efficient learning models for human robot interaction_. 
Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires knowledge of different fields. Except machine leanring algorithms, we also investigate on computational psychology models. We conduct both **fundamental and applied research** in our [social robotics lab](http://hri.research.it.uu.se).
