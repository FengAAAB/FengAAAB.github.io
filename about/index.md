Our aim is to answer a fundamental questions: **How could robots learn like us ?** We achieve this by developing new **robot learning models** using machine learning theories. The key of our research is to understand _what interactive elements make the learning process different_ and _how could we build an efficient learning model for human robot interactions_. 
Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires knowledge of different fields. Except machine leanring algorithms, we also investigate on computational psychology models. We conduct both fundamental and applied research in our [social robotics lab](http://hri.research.it.uu.se).

Personally, I am interested in machine learning, as applied to robotics. In particular, I am interested in deep/reinforcement learning approaches to robotic perception, control, and physical modeling of the robot's environment. I am currently working on projects that can fill the gap between deep reinforcement learning and human-in-the-loop robotics.
