In our Uppsala [social robotics lab](hri.research.it.uu.se), we aim to answer a fundamental question: **How could robots learn like humans ?** We achieve this by researching and developing new **robot learning models** using machine learning theories. The key of our research is to understand _what interactive elements make the learning process different_ and _how could we build efficient learning models for human robot interaction_. 
Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires knowledge of different fields. Except machine leanring algorithms, we also investigate on computational psychology models. We conduct both fundamental and applied research together with other collabrators around the world.


As a lifetime roboticist who wants to explore the boundaries of transhumanism, I am interested in developing **AI-driven** robots that can **think and feel** like real humans (e.g. [Ex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film))). In particular, I am interested in deep/reinforcement/neuro-based learning approaches to robotic **perception, control, and physical modeling** of the robot’s environment. Currently, I am working on projects that can fill the gap between deep reinforcement learning and social robotics.
