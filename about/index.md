Our aim is to answer a fundamental question: **How could robots learn like humans?** We achieve this by investigating **deep reinforcement learning algorithms** and computational behavior psychology models. Our research is **multi-disciplinary** and it requires understanding of different fields. We conduct both fundamental and applied research in our [social robotics lab](hri.research.it.uu.se).
